"""Contains functions to load benchmark instances.

    load_all_benchmark_instances
    load_benchmark_instance
    load_benchmark_json

You can load a benchmark instance from the library:

.. code-block:: python

    from job_shop_lib.benchmarking import load_benchmark_instance

    ft06 = load_benchmark_instance("ft06")


This package contains functions to load the instances from the file
and return them as :class:`JobShopInstance` objects without having to download
them manually.

The contributions to this benchmark dataset are as follows:

- ``abz5-9``: by Adams et al. (1988).

- ``ft06``, ``ft10``, ``ft20``: by Fisher and Thompson (1963).

- ``la01-40``: by Lawrence (1984)

- ``orb01-10``: by Applegate and Cook (1991).

- ``swb01-20``: by Storer et al. (1992).

- ``yn1-4``: by Yamada and Nakano (1992).

- ``ta01-80``: by Taillard (1993).

The metadata from these instances has been updated using data from:
https://github.com/thomasWeise/jsspInstancesAndResults

It includes the following information:
    - "optimum" (``int | None``): The optimal makespan for the instance.
    - "lower_bound" (``int``): The lower bound for the makespan. If
      optimality is known, it is equal to the optimum.
    - "upper_bound" (``int``): The upper bound for the makespan. If
      optimality is known, it is equal to the optimum.
    - "reference" (``str``): The paper or source where the instance was first
      introduced.

.. code-block:: python
