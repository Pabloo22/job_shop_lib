    Attributes:
        dispatching_rule:
            The dispatching rule to use. It is a callable that takes a
            dispatcher and returns the operation to be dispatched next.
        machine_chooser:
            Used to choose the machine where the operation will be dispatched
            to. It is only used if the operation can be dispatched to multiple
            machines.
        ready_operations_filter:
            The ready operations filter to use. It is used to initialize the
            dispatcher object internally when calling the solve method.

    Args:
        dispatching_rule:
            The dispatching rule to use. It can be a string with the name
            of the dispatching rule, a :class:`DispatchingRuleType` member,
            or a callable that takes a dispatcher and returns the operation to
            be dispatched next.
        machine_chooser:
            The machine chooser to use. It can be a string with the name
            of the machine chooser, a :class:`MachineChooserType` member, or a
            callable that takes a dispatcher and an operation and returns
            the machine id where the operation will be dispatched.
        ready_operations_filter:
            The ready operations filter to use. It can be either:

            - a string with the name of the pruning function
            - a :class`ReadyOperationsFilterType` enum member.
            - a callable that takes a dispatcher and a list of operations
              and returns a list of operations that should be considered
              for dispatching,
            - a list with names or actual ready operations filters to be used.
              If a list is provided, a composite filter will be created
              using the specified filters.
