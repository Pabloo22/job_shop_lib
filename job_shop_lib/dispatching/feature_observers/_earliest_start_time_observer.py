    each operation, machine, and job in the graph.

    The earliest start time of an operation refers to the earliest time at
    which the operation could potentially start without violating any
    constraints. This time is normalized by the current time (i.e., the
    difference between the earliest start time and the current time).

    The earliest start time of a machine is the earliest start time of the
    next operation that can be scheduled on that machine.

    Finally, the earliest start time of a job is the earliest start time of the
    next operation in the job.

            The :class:`~job_shop_lib.dispatching.Dispatcher` to observe.
        subscribe:
            If ``True``, the observer is subscribed to the dispatcher upon
            initialization. Otherwise, the observer must be subscribed later
            or manually updated.
