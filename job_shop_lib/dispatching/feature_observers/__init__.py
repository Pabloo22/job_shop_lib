A :class:`~job_shop_lib.dispatching.feature_observers.FeatureObserver` is a
a subclass of :class:`~job_shop_lib.dispatching.DispatcherObserver` that
observes features related to operations, machines, or jobs in the dispatcher.

Attributes are stored in numpy arrays with a shape of (``num_entities``,
``feature_size``), where ``num_entities`` is the number of entities being
observed (e.g., operations, machines, or jobs) and ``feature_size`` is the
number of values being observed for each entity.

The advantage of using arrays is that they can be easily updated in a
vectorized manner, which is more efficient than updating each attribute
individually. Furthermore, machine learning models can be trained on these
arrays to predict the best dispatching decisions.
