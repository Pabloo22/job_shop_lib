    A :class:`FeatureObserver` is a
    a subclass of :class:`~job_shop_lib.dispatching.DispatcherObserver` that
    observes features related to operations, machines, or jobs in the
    :class:`~job_shop_lib.dispatching.Dispatcher`.

    Attributes are stored in numpy arrays with a shape of (``num_entities``,
    ``feature_size``), where ``num_entities`` is the number of entities being
    observed (e.g., operations, machines, or jobs) and ``feature_size`` is the
    number of values being observed for each entity.

    The advantage of using arrays is that they can be easily updated in a
    vectorized manner, which is more efficient than updating each attribute
    individually. Furthermore, machine learning models can be trained on these
    arrays to predict the best dispatching decisions.

    Arrays use the data type ``np.float32``.

    New :class:`FeatureObservers` must inherit from this class, and re-define
    the class attributes ``_singleton`` (defualt ), ``_feature_size``
    (default 1) and ``_supported_feature_types`` (default all feature types).

    Feature observers are not singleton by default. This means that more than
    one instance of the same feature observer type can be subscribed to the
    dispatcher. This is useful when the first subscriber only observes a subset
    of the features, and the second subscriber observes a different subset of
    them. For example, the first subscriber could observe only the
    operation-related features, while the second subscriber could observe the
    jobs.

    Args:
        dispatcher:
            The :class:`~job_shop_lib.dispatching.Dispatcher` to observe.
        subscribe:
            If ``True``, the observer is subscribed to the dispatcher upon
            initialization. Otherwise, the observer must be subscribed later
            or manually updated.
        feature_types:
            A list of :class:`FeatureType` or a single :class:`FeatureType`
            that specifies the types of features to observe. They must be a
            subset of the class attribute :attr:`supported_feature_types`.
            If ``None``, all supported feature types are tracked.
