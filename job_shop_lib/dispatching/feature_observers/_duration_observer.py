    """Measures the remaining duration of operations, machines, and jobs.

    The duration of an :class:`~job_shop_lib.Operation` is:
        - if the operation has not been scheduled, it is the duration of the
          operation.
        - if the operation has been scheduled, it is the remaining duration of
          the operation.
        - if the operation has been completed, it is the last duration of the
          operation that has been computed. The duration must be set to 0
          manually if needed. We do not update the duration of completed
          operations to save computation time.

    The duration of a machine or job is the sum of the durations of the
    unscheduled operations that belong to the machine or job.

    Args:
        dispatcher:
            The :class:`~job_shop_lib.dispatching.Dispatcher` to observe.
        subscribe:
            If ``True``, the observer is subscribed to the dispatcher upon
            initialization. Otherwise, the observer must be subscribed later
            or manually updated.
        feature_types:
            A list of :class:`FeatureType` or a single :class:`FeatureType`
            that specifies the types of features to observe. They must be a
            subset of the class attribute :attr:`supported_feature_types`.
            If ``None``, all supported feature types are tracked.
