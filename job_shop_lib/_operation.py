class Operation:
    """Stores machine and duration information for a job operation.

    An operation is a task that must be performed on a machine. It is part of a
    job and has a duration that represents the time it takes to complete the
    task.

    Tip:
        To use custom attributes, such as due dates or priorities, subclass
        this class and add the desired attributes.

    Note:
        To increase performance, some solvers such as the CP-SAT solver use
        only integers to represent the operation's attributes. Should a
        problem involve operations with non-integer durations, it would be
        necessary to multiply all durations by a sufficiently large integer so
        that every duration is an integer.

    Args:
        machines:
            A list of machine ids that can perform the operation. If
            only one machine can perform the operation, it can be passed as
            an integer.

            The time it takes to perform the operation.
