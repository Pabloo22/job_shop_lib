    This observer updates the graph by removing the completed
    operation, machine and job nodes from the graph. It subscribes to the
    :class:`~job_shop_lib.dispatching.feature_observers.IsCompletedObserver`
    to determine which operations, machines and jobs have been completed.

    After an operation is dispatched, one of two disjunctive arcs that
    connected it with the previous operation is dropped. Similarly, the
    disjunctive arcs associated with the previous scheduled operation are
    removed.

    Attributes:
        remove_completed_machine_nodes:
            If ``True``, removes completed machine nodes from the graph.
        remove_completed_job_nodes:
            If ``True``, removes completed job nodes from the graph.

    Args:
        dispatcher:
            The dispatcher instance to observe.
        job_shop_graph:
            The job shop graph to update.
        subscribe:
            If ``True``, automatically subscribes the observer to the
            dispatcher. Defaults to ``True``.
        remove_completed_machine_nodes:
