"""Module for building the disjunctive graph of a job shop instance.

The disjunctive graph is created by first adding nodes representing each
operation in the jobs, along with two special nodes: a source $S$ and a sink
$T$. Each operation node is linked to the next operation in its job sequence
by **conjunctive edges**, forming a path from the source to the sink. These
edges represent the order in which operations of a single job must be
performed.

Additionally, the graph includes **disjunctive edges** between operations
that use the same machine but belong to different jobs. These edges are
bidirectional, indicating that either of the connected operations can be
performed first. The disjunctive edges thus represent the scheduling choices
available: the order in which operations sharing a machine can be processed.
Solving the Job Shop Scheduling problem involves choosing a direction for
each disjunctive edge such that the overall processing time is minimized.

    This function creates a complete disjunctive graph from a

    It starts by initializing a JobShopGraph object and proceeds by adding
    disjunctive edges between operations using the same machine, conjunctive
    edges between successive operations in the same job, and finally, special
    source and sink nodes with their respective edges to and from all other
    operations.

    Edges have a "type" attribute indicating whether they are disjunctive or
    conjunctive.
