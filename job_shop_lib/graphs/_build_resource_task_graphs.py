"""Contains helper functions to build the resource-task graphs from a job shop
instance.

The resource-task graph (originally called agent-task graph) was introduced by
Junyoung Park et al. (2021).
In contrast to the disjunctive graph, instead of connecting operations that
share the same resources directly by disjunctive edges, operation nodes are
connected with machine ones. All machine nodes are connected between them, and
all operation nodes from the same job are connected by non-directed edges too.
